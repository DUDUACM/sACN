# sACN

*Streaming ACN (sACN)* is an ANSI standard for entertainment technology by
[ESTA](http://tsp.esta.org) for transmission of DMX512 data over IP networks. sACN is widely used
in the entertainment industry for real-time control of entertainment technology, especially
lighting fixtures.

This repository contains a C-language library for communicating via sACN.

**NOTE**: This open-source implementation is still early in development, and currently only
receiving sACN is implemented.

## Building

For instructions on building the sACN library, as well as an sACN overview and in-depth
documentation, please see the [documentation](http://etclabs.github.io/sACN).

## Standard Version

The current version of this repository implements ANSI E1.31-2009. You can download the standard
document for free from the [ESTA TSP downloads page](https://tsp.esta.org/tsp/documents/published_docs.php). 

Updating to the new features in the 2016 and 2018 revisions of the standard are on the to-do list.
